					<b>Tekst piosenki: </b><br>
					<br>
					I been tryna call<br>
					I been on my own for long enough<br>
					Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br>
					I'm going through withdrawals<br>
					You don't even have to do too much<br>
					You can turn me on with just a touch, baby<br>
					<br>
					I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)<br>
					No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
					I can't see clearly when you're gone<br>
					<br>
					I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
					No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
					I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
					Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
					Hey, hey, hey<br>
					<br>
					I'm running out of time<br>
					'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br>
					So I hit the road in overdrive, baby<br>
					<br>
					Oh, the city's cold and empty (oh)<br>
					No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
					I can't see clearly when you're gone<br>
					<br>
					I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
					No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
					I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
					Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
					<br>
					I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)<br>
					I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)<br>
					Will never let you go this time (ooh)<br>
					<br>
					I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
					No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
					Hey, hey, hey<br>
					Hey, hey, hey<br>
					<br>
					I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
					No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
					No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
