					<b>Tekst piosenki: </b><br>
					<br>
					Risin' up, back on the street<br>
					Did my time, took my chances<br>
					Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet<br>
					Just a man and his will to survive<br>
					<br>
					So many times, it happens too fast<br>
					You trade your passion for glory<br>
					Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br>
					You must fight just to keep them alive<br>
					<br>
					It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
					Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
					And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
					And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger<br>
					<br>
					Face to face, out in the heat<br>
					Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry<br>
					They stack the odds 'til we take to the street<br>
					For the kill with the skill to survive<br>
					<br>
					It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
					Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
					And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
					And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger<br>
					<br>
					Risin' up, straight to the top<br>
					Had the guts, got the glory<br>
					Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop<br>
					Just a man and his will to survive<br>
					<br>
					It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
					Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
					And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
					And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger<br>
					<br>
					The eye of the tiger<br>
					The eye of the tiger<br>
					The eye of the tiger<br>
					The eye of the tiger<br>
					</p>
