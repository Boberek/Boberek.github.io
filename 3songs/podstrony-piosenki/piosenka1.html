					<b>Tekst piosenki: </b><br>
					<br>
					Feeling my way through the darkness<br>
					Guided by a beating heart<br>
					I can't tell where the journey will end<br>
					But I know where to start<br>
					They tell me I'm too young to understand<br>
					They say I'm caught up in a dream<br>
					Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes<br>
					Well that's fine by me<br>
					<br>
					So wake me up when it's all over<br>
					When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
					All this time I was finding myself<br>
					And I didn't know﻿ I was lost<br>
					<br>
					So wake me up when it's all over<br>
					When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
					All this time I was finding myself<br>
					And I didn't know﻿ I was lost<br>
					<br>
					I tried carrying the weight of the world<br>
					But I only have two hands<br>
					I hope I get the chance to travel the world<br>
					And I don't have any plans<br>
					I wish that I could stay forever this young<br>
					Not afraid to close my eyes<br>
					Life's a game﻿ made for everyone<br>
					And love is a prize<br>
					<br>
					So wake﻿ me up when it's all over<br>
					When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
					All this time I was finding myself<br>
					And I didn't know I was lost<br>
					<br>
					So wake me up when it's all over<br>
					When I'm wiser and I'm older<br>
					All this time I was finding myself<br>
					And I didn't know﻿ I was lost<br>
					<br>
					I didn't know I was lost<br>
					I didn't know I was lost<br>
					I didn't know I was lost<br>
					I didn't know I was lost<br>
					</p>
